A man has been shot dead after trying to seize a soldier's weapon at Orly airport in Paris, French officials say.
He was killed by the security forces after attacking a patrol in the airport's southern terminal.
The airport has now partially reopened after what the authorities described as an extremely serious incident.
The man, 39, was on a watch-list of radicalised individuals and had been involved in a shooting hours earlier in the north of Paris, police say.
He had a long criminal record including convictions for armed robbery, French media report.
